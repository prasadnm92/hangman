###Instructions to run on a Linux machine:

    - npm	(steps described with node installation steps)
    - mongo (use this for reference: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-on-linux/) - (you might need the Ubuntu or Debian recommendation)
         
* How to run:
    - run `npm install` in the project directory
    - make sure your MongoDB is running
    - run server using `node server.js` in the project directory
    - open browser and navigate to `localhost:3000/`
    - Guess away!!	
    - (optional) run `npm test` in the project directory to run some test cases
